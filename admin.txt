== Administrative Matters


Course combines theory and practice.  We will try ask the following
two questions.
  
  . Does it work in practice?
  . Does it work in theory?

As you know this is a graduate class.  This means that I don't care
about your grade. But if you are sitting here, you might as well work
for an A.

Grading will be based on some assignments, one midterm exam, and one
project. We shall make time so that you can devote a good chunk of
your semester to the project.  You will also be receive a
participation score, which amounts to 20\% of the grade.

For each lecture, I will make some notes and we shall make them
available for you to comment, perhaps via a github repository.
