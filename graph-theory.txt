=== Walk, Trails, Paths

A *_walk_* in a graph is a sequence of alternating vertex-edge pairs,
latexmath:[$v_0, e_1, v_1, \ldots, v_{n-1}, e_n, v_n$], such that
latexmath:[$e_i = (v_{i-1},v_i) \in E$].  Note that vertices and edges
can be repeated.  A walk corresponds to the intuitive notion of
``taking a walk in the graph.''

In a simple graph, where there are no parallel or multiple edges, we
can specify a walk as a sequence of vertices (which imply) the edges.

A *_trail_* in a graph is a walk where all edges are distinct, that is
no edge is traversed more than once.  Note that there can be repeated
vertices in a trail.  A trail corresponds to the intuitive notion that
it is a path with a purpose so it does not repeat the same edges.

A *_path_* is a graph is a walk where all edges and vertices are
distinct.

We say that a walk or a trail is *_closed_* if the initial and
terminal vertices are the same.

[[sec:graph-theory::euler-tours]]
=== Euler Tours

Given an undirected graph latexmath:[$G = (V,E)$], an *_Euler trail_*
is a trail that uses each edge exactly once.  An *_Euler tour_* is a
trail that is closed. In other words, it starts and terminates at the
same vertex.  We say that a graph is *_Eulerian_* if it has an Euler
tour.

It can be proven that a connected graph latexmath:[$G = (V,E)$] is
Eulerian if and only if every vertex latexmath:[$v \in V$]has even
degree.

These definitions generalize naturally to digraphs.
