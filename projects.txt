== Projects

. Locality-aware work stealing.  Steal the bottom of the deque if the
processor is close.  Bias steals toward close processors.  Design the
algorithm and implement in PASL (should be simple).  Does it work
well? Can you prove something about it?

. Tree contraction: when does it work?  What are the properties of
rakes and compresses?

. Dynamic stability of graph contraction/connectivity.
